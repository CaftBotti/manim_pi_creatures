# manim_pi_creatures
All pi creatures appear in 3b1b video

This repository is used for manim cairo-backend.
We're trying making different versions like manimgl and manimce.

**PiCreatures_happy.svg and so on**:

These are different emotions of pi creatures. They are from https://www.3blue1brown.com/images/pi-creatures/happy.svg and so on.

You need to put them in the `assets` folder.

We just put them in the repository for reference only, do not use them for commercial purposes!

**pi_creature.py**:

This python file is from cairo-backend, but we changed it a little (line 53 ~ 56) for all the pi creatures. Use the modified file instead of the original one
to see cute pi.
